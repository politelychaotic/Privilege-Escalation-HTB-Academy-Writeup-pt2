First off, because previously we learned that we can use `sudo -i -u user2 bash {bash script}` to run commands as user2 (who has superuser permissions at least to some extent), I used the same idea to create a bash script to read the `/root/id_rsa` file to see if I could ssh into the root user with the id_rsa key and no password.
